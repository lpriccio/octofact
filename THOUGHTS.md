we want to really use the huge expanse of space in a hyperbolic plane.  I like the use of truly enormous machines (a full 64x64 cell, or even bigger) in later-game play.  Also, having resources patches be few and far between (or just very clumpily distributed) could encourage this as well.


The 'overhead' view we've got works great as a map mode, no tweaks required.  Our current free camera mode is very helpful for development.  We should also include a more properly first-person mode where the player is bound by gravity (with mid-to-late games to mitigate or eliminate it, possibly all the way up to the current freecam mode)

Machine UI panel should display full cooridnates (cell, x, y).
